Never\nI put my hands up to Shuffle like I'm like I'm doing the macarena\nI'm thinkin' irony's something man's a friend of\nInstrumental in your own demise\nCause your flow's so shite they only wanna hear you accapella\n\n[Cracker]\nThat's why it ain't hard to see you can't bar on beat\nI mean that snowboarding excuse sounds a bit bizarre to me\nThis hip hop combat\nSo when we start to speak and our army's meet\nIt's like we're using machine gun fire and you're just using your arms and feet like Bart and Lisa\nDifferent artistry\nOur fit the bars regime\nYours is that well we can't rap so we use humor to get a laugh from Leeds\nNah, let me jump on Charlie's steez\nHe told Tony he flopped so he only reps half his league\nSo if you can't rap in a rap battle then you only rep half the scene\n[Cee Major]\nSo I can't really knock the guy's writtens but, what you rappin' for?\nFor, if you can't even follow time signature?\nSee, I'll have you headin' to the doc\nWhen I finish bud, T leaves in a bag like when we callin' out India\n\n[Cracker]\nSo forgive me if I don't see you as a conquest or a challenger\nA bit part of half of the solos you took the wrong step and got battlin'\nYour longevity is not set to be happening\nCause if you're only good at concept battles you don't understand the concept of battlin'\n\n[Cee Major]\nCause you could never out rap us, so judge we on some next shit\nBut what do you know about runnin' 'round the circuit when you had no money for the 'lectric?\nWhile it was cats we starved you had caviar that mommy did for breakfast\nI've been in studios since I was 13\nShuffle for this hustle I've been destined\nBut you don't even rap outside battles\nHence why you spend months and weeks on preppin'\nIt's st-st-st start stammer so much you sound like you're gonna fuckin' stumble into next spring\n\n[Cracker]\nSo while you came out of the blue with bars lyricists query\n\n[Cee Major]\nWe came from the ground up, that's Darwinian Theory\n[Cracker]\nBut have you ever wonder how Shuffle's rounds quickly got madly greater?\nAbout the time I introduced you to my boy in fact\nNow I'm not sayin' man's a traitor\nBut he helps you get straight to the point\nAnd you act like it's not a massive favor\nSo if his phrases sound frank today that's due to Frankie Phraser\nAnd Eurgh, I'd have a little second poll if you think this man's mate is a [?]\nHe told me you an arrogant sad waste\nWho does what he wants, just cause you were mad late\nThen you didn't say the shit to a man's face\nHe's the only reason you have a fan base and the sole reason anyone knows your damn name\nAnd Shuffle, remember when you told me half your fans are retards?\nReal talk\nYou want to say it to 'em now\n\n[Cee Major]\nWhat's up cousin? You wasn't so shy when they wasn't around\n\n[Cracker]\nThey see you as a king but try to win this on favors from the crowd\nNah you King Charles the 1st man they'll slay you for the crown\nTime\n\n[Round 1: Marlo]\nYou guys are sooo pissed off about this\nCracker, you look furious mate\n[Shuffle] Truly enraged\n[Marlo] Eurgh was like-\n[S] \"You gotta go through with it mate\"\n[M] And you were like-\n[S] \"Yeah, yeah, nah, nah I'll do what you say.\"\n[M] Awww, don't worry, we know you don't agree we're in a suitable place\nBut if that's truly the case then we'll lose anyway and the views will be great\nSo dude, it's okay!\n[S] In your blog diss to us, you guys were swooning with praise\nYou said we'd lose here today but we do entertain\nAnd that's what I think these dudes got confused in a way\nCause it's called Don't Flop Entertainment boy...the clue's in the name\nAnd you guys only won that tournament cause we weren't there\nJust face it the bets through\nOnly got that title cause we basically let you\nBut now we made it our houses, the change of address due\nBut we hope that you enjoyed your stay in the guest room\n[M] And if you put this all into context it spits itself\nI mean you guys won this great big contest and it was swell\nBut now, we've been offered to win bell four rounds after getting bodied by Mick' and L\n\n[Both]\n[?] battles now we're here\nDidn't have to battle for the whole damn fuckin' year\n\n[Shuffle T]\nWe thought we'd get rid of Cracker this round since you two have already battled\nAnd now I'm here and I'm lookin' to accept the challenge\nYou-\n\n[Marlo]\n-I LET YOU WIN\nYou hated, HATED those ginger jokes\nLook, I'm sorry you have red hair\nI didn't realize before we battled you didn't actually know that\nI never planned to expose Crack but his reactions were so sad\nWhich leads me to believe he hadn't been shown that\nI expected rolled eyes and a sarcastically slow clap\nNow the most fucked up cry face since Carrie from Homeland\n\n[Shuffle T]\nYou need to stop gettin' mad when other battlers address the fact\nThat your head is red ya twat\nLike, of course it's comin' up, I mean imagine you're against a man with legs for hands\nYou're gonna wanna mention that\nWhat have you got to complain about?\nYou won this big tourney and got fuckin' half the prize\nI bet you went and fuckin' partied, right?\nI bet you were burning money for cigars to light\nNope! He used it pay his overdraft in time\nWhat's next Crack? Win first place in Masterminds\nSo you can finally pay off that parking fine?\n\n[Marlo]\nWhen Cracker got his money, I thought maybe he made a stash\nThe fact that he was in debt, the moment he had it he paid it back\nAnd Marcus gave his to the Mosque so we're just restating facts\nHe and Cee Major have, a complete waste of cash\nWho needs money when you've got baaaars Leeds\n\n[Shuffle T]\nYou don't have baaaaars Leeds\nCracker just forced his simple simile shit delivery inconsistently to fit the imagery\nSeriously, you always use similes that don't spark\n\n[Marlo] Like a wack lighter\n[Shuffle T] You just google it and say \"like\"\n[Marlo] Like a fact finder\n[Shuffle T] You always take the longest route to get there\n[Marlo] Like a cab driver\n[Shuffle T] Underneath it you just write bad\n[Marlo] Like a bad writer\nNow you said the word \"Shawshank\" in a rap battle\nNow I'm not saying I don't understand the words you speak\nOh wait, I am, and I'm saying it perfectly\n\n[Shuffle T]\nSee for Cracker the speaking matter can be a hazard\n\n[Marlo] I mean imagine, he's on a date\n[Shuffle T] Pizza tavern\n[Marlo] That's okay\n[Shuffle T] She's a slapper\n[Marlo] It's goin' great\n[Shuffle T] Cheeky banter\n[Marlo] Til the waiter comes and asks him what they would want for starters\n[Shuffle T] Leans to Cracker\n[Marlo] Who says he'd like a medium platter of caesar salad\nHe'd like a medium platter of cae-\nHe'd like a medium platter of cae-\n[Shuffle T] Forget it man forget it, forget it\n\n[Marlo]\nOn our journey to Plymouth I was next to this guy\nImagine the following but for the length of the drive\n\"Who the fuck is KennedySpikes75?\nAnd why is he saying I'm desperate for hype?\nFuck it, that's it I'm pressing \"dislike\" that'll send a message but Christ\nHow pathetic is that prick tellin' me lies?\nI love how-I love how they think they're gonna get to me guys.\"\nIf you see him in the crowd during the battle and he's on his phone\nHe's not takin' notes so he can judge a round on content\nHe's on his Olde English battle thumbing down the comments\n\n[Shuffle T] Now you guys seem to think that when it comes to bars Leeds will never listen\n[Marlo] Like they're only after laughter and don't seek your depth of wisdom\n[Shuffle T] The same Leeds that went crazy when they received the Flex' decision\n[Marlo] The same Leeds that went insane when Tony had beaten Deffinition?\n[Shuffle T]\nBaring that in mind we don't wanna see you ever bitchin'\n[Marlo] The same lame complaints claimin' Leeds won't get your writtens\n\n[Shuffle T]\nThat excuse is wearing thinner than a fiend with meth addiction\nJust poppin' out to a needle exhibition\nThe fact in the book is you can rap from the hood\nBut to get reaction you actually have to be good\n\n[Round 2: Cee Major]\nSee I think that it's wild you look up to another man so much you became a mimicking child\nAnd they think it's just tricks up your sleeve, nah but give them a while\nI clock from day one with his emo fashion\nThat's just that Mark Grist in your style\n\n[Cracker]\nYou took another man's style, and I ain't talkin' 'bout Neo\nMark Grist got 3,000,000 views and you crept in the scene on the D. lo'\nNow you can say that's a coincidence but we know\nYou have to see it from Mark's point of view like Peep Show\n\n[Cee Major]\nWe really didn't wanna do this battle but we sorta had to\nCause you spark up a lil' interest and we were forced to match you\nBut really the only way you want performance value\nAnd we got three grand, four battles, oh, how much is your performance value?\n\n[Cracker]\nCause we're like Heisenberg when we write a verse\nNot one poor step man will make that paper\nJesse Pinkman penning writtens throw it on your doorstep like, \"take that player\"\nWhen I hear a good Shuffle bar I'm like, \"Yeeeeah, kinda rate that Phraser\"\nBut uncle Crack' made up his mind to kill him ten minutes ago\nHe's Asac Schrader\n\n[Cee Major]\nBut if it's a question of who comes harder it's Futurama\nFeel the irony of an iron sentence\nHe's tried and tested cryogenics\nFlow cold enough to fry your bredren\nPound for pound I'll break your unit down, it's fine\nI can divide the metrics\nRun up on bars over heads like I'm trying to apply the methods of plyometrics\n\n[Cracker]\nCause you look like you haven't been

lyin' dead\nYou went from your tryout then\nWent from fox huntin' with your posh cousin and jumped straight into the lion's den\nLiterary architect\nWhen I pick up my writin' pen\nUni boy best get to Spark Notes to revise the texts\n\n[Cracker]\nCause Marlo I heard your shitty mash up music man\nIt's dark as [?] listen\nCause your mixes sound like the start up of a Tony Stark system\nIf I drop that whack bollocks now, that's a Math Hoffa round\nYou see half of the bomb missin'\nSo when his Krusty set drops I'll say \"I didn't do it\" and they'll laugh I'm Bart Simpson\n\n[Cee Major]\nAnd you dissed RS for being Christian\n[Cracker] How does that shit work?\n[Cee Major] When you look like Jesus\n[Cracker] Yeah, Catholic jerks\n[Cee Major] But your girl's an Indian from a Muslim family\nSo if you choose to play religion\nIt's cause you felt the restraints from the shake/Sheikh like Haitian victims\nThey say I'm arrogant, egotistical\n[Cracker] Nah state the difference\n[Cee Major] I'm out to kill for honor like her family when she claims she's with him\nCause she's ashamed of you\nAin't told her relatives about the way you live\nCause you can't take care of her like her relations do\nSo it's not due to their devotion to faith\nIt's due to her lack of faith in you\nAnd that's why she's straight aborting if you...papa Don\nCause she don't want none of it\nShe been fuckin' wit that Marlo kid\nCause she can't believe how dull he is\nSo if she ever claim that she's carrying your offspring\n\n[Cracker]\nDon't be surprised if it looks like a younger Boris Johnson\n\n[Cee Major]\nAnd I'm sorry for the awkward journey home brother\nBut these were foreshadowed words\nShe's a musician named Aaliyah, it was plain/plane to see that was gonna crash and burn\n\n[Cracker]\nCause you told Anton Murphy God wouldn't come down to help him win a battle\nAnd then you said-\n[Cee Major] \"I'm Thomas Aquinas with God on my side\"\n[Cracker] You flippin' fraggel\nNow if God's on your side I'm not sure which part you save through Him\nBut I'm pretty sure the last person he'll possess is a middle class atheist\nSo feel the adrenaline hit your heart like Uma Thurman\nI'll fuck up your whole system\nI'm not no Willis but the two punch combo pop won't miss him\nTom's no Christian, fuck divine intervention\nGod won't visit as if my shots won't hit him\nCall the Wolf when I leave posh dome missing like that car scene shot in Pulp Fiction\n\n[Round 2: Marlo]\nOkay, hold on, time out, back up a sec'\nWe've all had a good laugh, rapping with threats\nThe atmosphere's tense, Cracker's in sweats\nBut now there's really something impressive that we have to address\nThat angle you penned, about Bamalam's rent having to end\nDon't you ever, EVER, make Bagnall feel that fuckin' awkward in a battle again\nDoin' jokes in this battle? It's fuckin' hard\nI mean how can this clash be a big wonderful laugh\nWhen you got Cee over here with a stick up his ass?\n\n[Shuffle T]\nI can imagine him writin', Cracker [?]\nTongue's gettin' bored so he cracks a lil' random quip\nCee Major's used to this by now he's practiced it and has to grin like, \"Ha ha ha...yeah, can we, actually get back to this.\"\n\n[Marlo]\nFuck this man's depressing line of business slides\nAnd that sad expression hiding in his eyes\nHe's on that no humor tactic, so bureaucratic\nYou can actually sense him tightening his tie\n\n[Shuffle T]\nBut hold on, wait\nCan anyone back up this man's age?\nI mean it's 14 plus, right?\n[Marlo] Yeah\n[Shuffle T] Was there an allowance for Crack's mate?\n[Marlo] You could walk into a GCSC exam and it wouldn't be weird\nNo one would say\n[Shuffle T] \"You shouldn't be here.\"\n[Marlo] They'd just be like\n[Shuffle T] \"Aww, look at the kid pushin' the beard.\"\n\n[Marlo]\nYou're literally six, you haven't grown into an adult bro\nI don't think Marcus is even old enough to be acne prone\nType to answer the door at the flat he owns just to be asked, \"Is your mummy or daddy home?\"\n\n[Shuffle T]\nMarcus you act all hard but we're baffled\nHow are you the geekiest looking guy in this battle?\n\n[Marlo]\nJust imagine this fuckin' nerd clubbin'\nA bet a ton of girls love it when he jump and turn struttin' like a Thunderbird's puppet\n\n[Shuffle T] {imitating Cee Major}\nNah, nah, nah but you claimin' bein' tough is all humor\nAll with that peace trainin', must've had a poor tutor\nYou got more shooters than Storm Troopers\nNah, you soundin' less Walt' White and more Walt Jr\n\nI got a good one, I got a good one\nYou know what rhymes with \"Cee Major's religion\"?\n\n[Marlo] I suppose you'll want to tell me\n[Shuffle T] How about, \"He changes for women\"?\nNah nah\nHow 'bout, \"He details his opinion for three days and then switchin'\nA week later it's different from a weed blazin' addiction to refraining from drinkin'\"\n[Marlo] Yeah I guess that rhymed\n[Shuffle T] Chill, chill...she's made the decision\n\n[Marlo]\nHis wife's the man, it's kinda sad how he's whipped like a flan\nHe stays under the thumb like a hitchhiker's bags\nThis prick tries to act like he lives like a man but his chick style of pants...that is kinda bland\n\n[Shuffle T]\nCee's girl? She stays in power\nShe don't just wear the pants she makes you MAKE the trowsers\nI know she's taught you to revere Mecca\nAnd religion is alright...but beer's better\nSince you already look like the year 7th, you're going to give in to the peer pressure\n\n[Marlo]\nI've got some true fuckin' shit I'd like to chew up and spit\nCause Cee's in a religion but the shoe doesn't fit\nI mean when you've stuck to script I bet it's lubed up your chick\nBut when you entered in a contest and you threw money in...that gambling see, regardless of who won the chips\nYou went against your own beliefs for a few bloody quid\nAnd I don't think the mosque would approve of such a sin\nBut you've truly disregarded how true Muslim's live\nWhen you partnered up with this guy...cause that's a HUGE fuckin' risk\n\n[Shuffle T]\nAnd let's face it you guys are hardly content\nAnd I love how hard Cee pretends but to be honest you guys aren't even friends\n\n[Marlo]\nThey suck at being friends\nThey run into each other at events like, \"Oh I didn't know you were comin' with weekend.\"\n\n[Shuffle T]\nHey, even their handshakes are messily disgraced\nHe goes to give him respect cause he's your mate\nAnd he accidentally decks him in the face\n\n[Marlo]\nI reckon Cee just hates Cracker and Cracker has no idea\nHow can we truly prove this to make it work?\n[Shuffle T] On the count of three say each other's date of birth\n[Marlo] Ha ha ha; 5th of February\n[Shuffle T] 29th of October\n[Marlo] We are way better mates than you two are!\nWe're better best friends than you'll ever get with your respective best friends that neither of you have respectively ever met yet\n[Shuffle T] I'm gay for this guy, no homo!\n[Marlo] I'm gay for you too, no Bono!\n[Shuffle T] It's every second spent together\n[Marlo] Friends forever!\n[Shuffle T] Penn & Teller\n[Marlo] Sketch and Sensa\n[Shuffle T] Pesc' & Bender\n[Marlo] Egg and pepper\n[Shuffle T] Meth and Ke$ha\n[Marlo] Ed and Bella\n[Shuffle T] Yeah whatever!\n\n[Marlo]\nWhat we're sayin' is, you never could predict such a chemistry as this\nI said the energy is sick and we're intelligent with it\nYou were the two remaining losers paired together at the gym\nSo you're never going to bring the same magnetism in\n\n[Shuffle T]\nYou got together for the shit but you never should've mixed\nYou were definitely pissed all the [?] wasn't missed\nYou're like a fella and a chick who got a wedding as a fix\nAnd now you're only keeping it together for the kids!\n\n[Round 3: Cracker]\nYo, don't listen to what they said these faggots are just shoutin'\nWe were the best from the first round of the tournament there was no gamblin' about it\nBut don't think you winnin' just cause we in Leeds, Don\nEase off my foot in your face taste the Reeboks\nI'll have him spittin' kicks like\n\n[Cee Major] \"Damn, I didn't know you could beatbox\"\n\n[Cracker]\nWinners of the tournament look at how many teams drop now\nT's dawg's surrounded by the dead as he dies in front of this bitch like T-Don\n\n[Cee Major]\n[?] stand grand on his land two feet\nBut don't step into my vicinity the quicksand too deep\nYeah you climbin' the ladder but don't let the support gas you please\nYou'll be left with no leg to stand on if you fall for the way they amp you T (amputee)\n\n[Cracker]\nAnd now posh boy gonna love it\nCause you put Shuffle into spar but I'm snuffin' him\nCross cuttin' him, Marli shufflin' every bar\nThese queens ain't got a W, spit nothin' from the heart\nSo now you got kings out of place cause of Shuffle in the cards\nBut deal me in it's 21, you're now fuckin' with the best\nDon't show me your hands, that shit's bread and butter to the vets\nWe already said we're two kings so hittin' us is somethin' you'll regret\nAnd now the deck ain't gettin' shuffled, nah Shuffle gettin' decked\n\n[Cee Major]\nBecause you men are actors I see it well\nStand up guys/stand up comedians hell\nRidin' for a dime, no lie man was in need of help\nCause really how the fuck you diss the man who's already a parody of himself?\nMarlo!

I make her lose a couple\n[Cee Major] And she can pass a lonely one, and I don't mean to boot shoot your bubble\n[Cracker] But I make you walk it by yourself, without Cupid, Shuffle\nCause I've got that heavy ammo, fuck up your band like a [?] Django\nDon't rap bro, old school went over your head like Kangol\nI took first when we last battled, shit got messier than Rambo\nThought I was done, until I pop up in the end and kill him like Benny Blanco\nLook, I'm William Tell with arrows, I'll definitely get his mango\nYou said you wanted sperm on your face\n[Cee Major] Don't think we were forgettin' that bro\n[Cracker] To me that's duty free I'm just here to send these fags home\nTo sayin' they wanted to be undercover with Lefty like that fella Brasco\n[Cee Major] So yeah you popular now, risen a couple of tiers\n[Cracker] But there's no passion in your accent you just do it for the love from your peers\n[Cee Major] The difference between us, we never done it for cheers\n[Cracker] So what's flavor of the month to two rappers that been hungry for years?\n\n[Round 3: Shuffle T]\nSpeakin' of Bad Bars...in your Olde English battle you did somethin' I didn't believe\nI mean you said it was an Olde English literature scheme\nThat literally puts you at the height of idiocy\nCause the title should've been \"English At Least\"\nAnd your wordplay schemes never seem over to me\nSo go on and on about crap we can't cope to believe\nThen the wordplay's barely even literature it kinda goes to a beat\n\n[Marlo]\nThis could genuinely pass as one of their associate schemes\n\n[Shuffle T] For that Diana; Ross\n[Marlo] If Cee saw (seesaw) if he plain too let that Coco Pops\n[Shuffle T] I'm that final cut\n[Marlo] Bro so you know\n[Shuffle T] When I Han Solo shot\n[Marlo] They ain't got the key for (Kiefer) Sutherland\nThey walk in (Walking) Dead\n[Shuffle T] He don't [?] J, son born again\n[Marlo] Flying monkeys, watch that Zoo land Er (Zoolander)\n[Shuffle T] If he Mike & The Mechanics, I'm a [?] Cracker bottle\nAmelie, it's a mixture of the two\nBut the fact is...you are a cunt\n[Marlo] I [?] can sir (cancer)\n[Shuffle T] Bitch\n\n[Marlo]\nBut fuck the jokes, we haven't come to roast\nThe Shuffle bros can fuck off home\nWe've come to turn these buns to toast with schemes that drag longer than Shuffle's coat\n\n[Shuffle T]\nThe stuff we wrote could cut your throat\nThe stuff you wrote is a loving poke, a hug at most\nNo originality just a couple clones sayin' the same shit over and over like Lux's choke\n\n[Marlo]\nTo us you're both a running joke, so it's punches thrown til our knuckles broke\nWe pulled you out your comfort zone, so your championship's a sunken boat\n\n[Shuffle T] Skull and bones\n[Marlo] Up in smoke\n[Shuffle T] Covered over with undergrowth\n[Marlo] Cause we're nothing more than luck you've drove up the road to the Double's throne\n[Shuffle T] But wait wait wait wait\nWhat's the talk about how they won the doubles, just one more joke\n[Marlo] Go on then\n[Shuffle T] You know what rhymes with \"Crack' and Major\"?\nIt's \"Frankie Phraser\"\n[Marlo] I know what you're insinuating\nBut they got bars on their own Crack' and him\n[Shuffle T] Name one\n[Marlo] Dog's spots like Cruella Deville\n[Shuffle T] Frankie's gem\n[Marlo] Ah, braise sweater/Swave Sevah\n[Shuffle T] Frank again\n[Marlo] Ah, venom snakebite, Devil May Cry\n[Shuffle T] I actually wrote that but fuck it, Frank again\n[Marlo] Your voice ain't been the same since Bulletz like Curtis Jackson\n[Shuffle T] Pssst yeah that was them\nThat is fine if you're okay with takin' Frankie's line\nThat's not the problem, the problem is you robbed him\n\n[Marlo]\nFrankie Phraser! What happened Frankie Phraser?\nI don't know why they haven't paid ya\n\n[Shuffle T]\nSee the fact is, if we had written with Frank to be given some cash\nIt'd be a vicious attack if we didn't give him some bag\n\n[Marlo]\nHe gave you your best lines it's as simple as that\nHe was a huge part of you two even winning a match\n\n[Shuffle T]\nSo for not looking out for him for scripting your clash\nYou have to live with the fact that you're stabbing him in the back\nDon't get it confused it ain't about being tight with cash\nThis is about that money going back into it's rightful hands\n\n[Marlo]\nThe shit that you actually write? You claim you're sick with pen and paper\nBut your bars are just a simpler replication of a bigger presentation\nWithout the fuckin' nuts; Snicker celebration\nMotherfuck this, I feel a pinch of devastation\nWhen kids attempt to claim these boring pricks could rep the face of a thing of entertainment\nIt would be like the league tried enlisting Kevin Bacon\nCause they'd risk the reputation of everything, everywhere with their cringy desperation\n\n[Shuffle T]\nBut look, I think it's about time to describe it bluntly\nFuck this childish dummy and the Bride Of Chucky\nYou act surprised we succeed with a style that's funny\nBut of course we're entertaining it's required of us, see?\nIt's what makes us top 5 doubles inside the country\n\n[Marlo]\nLike Bagnall, Bam' and Crug' on their final cut steez\nWe've rendered our entire timeline a must see\nFrom driving up fleet tryin' to bust free's\nTo the greatest thing to happen online since [?]\nYou guys are lucky I couldn't find the fuckin' time or money for the signing up fee\nCause though you seem to think you'd have wiped the rug clean\nIt would've been a very different final trust me\n\n[Shuffle T]\nYou guys act like you're some giant name that are battlin' like you've acquired fame\nBut no one believes those lies you claim\nAnd when we swoop in and take the title chain\nYou'll even have to hide away from cyber space like Pirate Bay\nSee we made Don't Flop's climate change like tidal waves or seismic plate  when they slide and shake\nWe bring in the black clouds and sky's of grey\nYou just fill in the background like Skylar Grey\n\n[Marlo] It's the lightest flame to a fireplace\n[Shuffle T] Shania Twain to Brian Mays\n[Marlo] A Twilight page to Snipe's Blade\n[Shuffle T] You're tryna place us some live grenades\n[Marlo] It's child's play\n[Shuffle T] You think you go overheads like a bride's bouquet\n[Marlo] Nope, you bore them so much they hibernate\n[Shuffle T] You act like you get to work and grind away, night and day like Miley Ray Cyrus made\nBut what comes out is you both is a cryin' shame\n[Marlo] You'll both lead Don't Flop to it's final grave\n[Shuffle T] And we're here to save it\n[Marlo] It's time for change\n[Shuffle T] It's changing time\n[Marlo] Your fame and hype has gained in size\nBut claim that you can keep running the game's a lie\nYou can break the ice and race for life\nCause all I see is a couple ladies takin' strides\nBut hats off to Crack dawg and Maj'\nI mean three grand on the plate and absolutely no help from Frank\nOn the way\n[Shuffle T] At least that's what they'll say\nBut they're gassed off the fame\nThey'll slack off and make the fans want to hate and that's got to change\n[Marlo] Our aims to have everyone back on today like that was the day that chance got replaced\nCause yeah our pronounced voices may sound bad posh and gay\nBut at least everybody understands what we say!\n\n[Shuffle T]\nSee no one expected us, but we're the covert forces in the Trojan Horses at your stony fortress\nTricked you into an open drawbridge\nGoin' forward til there's only loads of bonus corpses and broken swords it's\nNo performance or vocal cords vs the overloads of Roman warships\nAnd now you're gettin' tossed overboard and thrown towards the open waters\n\n[Marlo] Think about it, how quickly we've been leapin' over borders\n[Shuffle T] Three battles as a pair and now we're beatin' those before us\n[Marlo] The staff pushed us forward, we've got heaps of close supporters\n[Shuffle T] We don't need to prove why we're the champs\n[Both] The league has spoken for us!1Embed"

        "lyrics": "3 ContributorsAretha Franklin’s “Amazing Grace” (33 1/3 excerpt) LyricsChapter FourI suppose the [Black] Revolution influenced me a great deal, but I must say that mine was a very personal evolution — an evolution of the me in myself. But then I suppose that the whole meaning of the Revolution is very much tied up with that sort of thing, so it certainly must have helped what I was trying to do for myself.\n—Aretha Franklin to Charles L. Sanders in “Aretha: A Close-up Look at Sister Superstar,” Ebony, December 1971At the time Aretha Franklin spoke with Charles L. Sanders for Ebony in her Manhattan apartment, she had already recorded the hits that would keep her in designer gowns and extravagant hats for life. The interview would have been around the summer of 1971; there’s a reference to her upcoming album Young, Gifted and Black, which she had finished recording in February of that year. Franklin briefly mentioned her plans for Amazing Grace, saying that she was “real excited” about the gospel recording and that “it’s going to be done with James Cleveland and we’ll record it in a church with a real good choir.” Franklin also seems to be thinking about the era’s social movements. The article begins with Sanders noticing that the singer’s bookshelf includes The Negro Handbook, Frantz Fanon’s A Dying Colonialism and “that far out Eros and Civilization by Angela Davis’ old professor, Dr. Herbert Marcuse.” As usual, Franklin said little, but the article does point to how she had reinvented herself since 1966.\n\nWhen Dobkin wrote about Franklin’s move to Atlantic from Columbia in I Never Loved a Man the Way I Loved You, he attests that, despite portrayals to the contrary, Wexler did not just take her back to church when she signed to his company. He adds what made her early Atlantic records command the wide audience that alluded her earlier: “The novelty of Aretha’s first Atlantic releases, the element that pushed her into the popular-music stratosphere was not gospel fervor (though that certainly helped). It was sex.”1 Possibly, but that’s not quite the whole story, and one could also counter that a reason why Franklin’s church followers did not abandon her was that she didn’t ooze sexuality to the extent of, say, Marvin Gaye. And she usually didn’t mix up two different concepts of love as strangely as her male Detroit counterpart did when he trailed off “Let’s Get It On” with his own context for the word “Sanctified.” She chose a different role.\n\nAfter all, it wasn’t just sensuality that put Franklin’s version of Otis Redding’s “Respect” in Jet’s Soul Brothers Top 20 poll, and awarded her a citation from Dr. Marin Luther King, Jr.’s Southern Christian Leadership convention in the summer of 1967.2Whether Franklin asked for it or not, she became a cultural heroine in a way that set her apart from such aggressively sexual predecessors as Dinah Washington. By 1971, the empowerment that “Respect” and “Think” embodied turned even more overt in her blazing rendition of Nina Simone’s “Young, Gifted and Black.” She also started to front a working band that sounded at home backing her in New York and Miami studios, the epicenter of San Francisco’s rock scene, and, ultimately, the church where she, and most of that group, began. It’s the sort of skilled and sympathetic unit that would be the vehicle for any musical advances. Her songs became longer, and stretched out over new, different and often free-flowing rhythms: she achieved the sense of liberation that her voice always demanded. That Franklin was also delving deeper, and more openly, into gospel fervor at that time wasn’t paradoxical.\n\nMuch of what’s been written about Franklin during this period points toward a newfound sense of confidence, albeit one mixed with an aura of mystery that lasts to this day.3 As the ’60s concluded, she ended her marriage and professional connection to Ted White. For whatever reason, Franklin avoided the recording studios for several months at a time between 1968–1970, much to Wexler’s chagrin. When she did show up, the results were hits that defined the times (“Think,” “I Say a Little Prayer” from Aretha Now in mid-1968) or are reminders that she still could have been a prominent jazz vocalist (the mis-titled Soul ’69). She also delved into the Sanctified rhythms and call-and-response vocals on her composition “Spirit in the Dark,” the title track of her summer 1970 album. The lyrics picked up from Wilson Pickett’s exhortations to dance and some nursery rhymes, but the title itself comes straight from Sanctified churches’ belief in feeling the holy spirit — and one could speculate if the “dark” suggests a negative (troubled times) or positive (pigmentation).4 With piano lines and crescendos sounding as strong as her voice, the beat is the most direct line to a storefront church that she had recorded for Atlantic up to that point. Despite such exuberance, her muted comments about it are oblique.\n\n“Well, it’s true that I have to really feel a song before I’ll deal with it, and just about every song I do is based on an experience I’ve had or an experience that someone I know has gone through,” Franklin told Sanders in Ebony. “‘Spirit in the Dark’? Hmmmh ... that’s one I’d rather not talk about. It’s very, very personal and I don’t want to get into it right now.”\n\nIt also wasn’t the only gospel-shaped song that she recorded back then. Rainey played bass on her 1971 single, “Spanish Harlem,” and refers its “cross between an eighth-note feel and a shuffle.”\n\n“That’s the gospel, Pentecostal feel where you’re really trying to nail what the groove is,” Rainey added. “If you want to write it down for somebody, you can’t. You just have to sort of listen to it and feel it. But in playing with her, she brought out another energy. It’s a kind of feel that’s not descriptive. I always try, but it’s very difficult.”\n\nHer performances were also infrequent, although when she appeared onstage in the spring of 1970, Franklin expressed ambitious plans, especially an ongoing involvement with traditional church music. Her intentions included bringing gospel to Broadway with her sister Carolyn, and a television special in Israel to be called “Aretha in the Holy Land.”5 When Franklin performed at the Las Vegas International Hotel on June 8, 1970 (her first concert in almost a year), she included Albertina Walker and The Caravans on the bill and would continue touring with this group into the following year. She also insisted on the hotel hiring an all-black ensemble for the show, which must have been an audacious request for this historically segregated city.6\n\nFranklin’s refocus on gospel intertwined with early 1970’s cultural discourse. For someone growing up in C. L. Franklin’s family, the black consciousness movement of that era was not a jolt. Much of the organizational force behind the civil rights movement was built, and debated, within black churches, and the institutions’ music and musicians have always been there. In particular, when Aretha Franklin was a child, she would’ve seen her father chastise the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) for not doing enough to organize Detroit’s African American communities, and witnessed his equally daring support of the young Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. She and Mahalia Jackson remained alongside King, and Franklin sang “Precious Lord, Take My Hand” at his funeral.\n\nIn the post-King era, Franklin’s cultural embrace became more public and took on an artistic dimension. In her memoirs, she states that much of this came from her new boyfriend, Ken Cunningham. He’s described in terms of the Black Arts Movement, which was burgeoning not far from their New York home, and included Nikki Giovanni. Franklin mentions Cunningham’s plans for a black-owned fashion business, the New Breeders, which would feature African-inspired clothes. When I asked Giovanni how much Franklin’s thinking at this time reflected the Black Aesthetic concept — as articulated by herself and such other writers as Larry Neal — she simply replied, “Aretha was the black aesthetic.”\n\n“Daddy had been preaching black pride for decades, and we as a people had rediscovered how beautiful black truly was and were echoing, ‘Say it loud, I’m black and I’m proud.’” Franklin told Ritz. “Wolf [Ken Cunningham] and I embodied that pride. I stopped shaving my eyebrows and using pencils and went back to a natural look with a much lighter touch. I lost weight and wore my hair in an Afro; I began to appreciate myself as a beautiful black woman.”7\n\nJust as explicitly, she recorded Simone’s “Young, Gifted and Black” in August 1970. The song’s message, written by a Methodist minister’s granddaughter who Franklin admired, speaks for itself. Franklin also leads a pulpit-influenced call-and-response with her gospel-rooted back-up singers, The Sweet Inspirations. The changes in her group at that time proved equally crucial. Rainey and guitarist Cornell Dupree played on this song, and Purdie worked on half the other tracks of Franklin’s album of the same name. While Franklin had top sidemen throughout her earlier Atlantic sessions, this new core rhythm section essentially became a working band. All three had played alongside the dynamic Texas-bred, New York-based saxophonist King Curtis in the mid ’60s. Curtis, a favorite of Franklin and Wexler, didn’t so much straddle the borders among r&b, rock, and hard bop, but annihilated the gates. They also shared early experiences in the black church, albeit Purdie and Rainey more than Dupree. The other keyboardists on the Young, Gifted and Black album — Cleveland’s protégé Billy Preston and Donny Hathaway — had also been immersed in similar religious backgrounds. If the principles of pride, strength, and mutual respect were hallmarks of the Black Arts Movement and African American spirituality, this group lived it, according to Purdie:We listened to one another and out of respect for what we were doing, we felt that nobody could come between us and move us out of our space. To allow yourself to do your thing, you have to have other people supporting you and we supported each other so well, so much with the rhythm, we were never thinking about solo work. Just rhythm. You just wanted to have the biggest and tightest rhythm section in the world and nobody could come in and squeeze you out. That sound incorporated itself with everybody around us, and then they could just sweeten the pot when they wanted to add a piano, another guitar or something. But the rhythm section was always super, super tight because of the respect we had for each other. It wasn’t about us, it wasn’t about solo work, it was about a section.The affinity has lasted.\n\n“If I were a drummer, I’d play exactly like Bernard and if I were a guitar player, I’d hope to play rhythm like Cornell,” Rainey said.\nThis shared respect came about even with their considerably different personalities. Dupree grew up in Curtis’ hometown of Fort Worth and played r&b in Texas bars until the saxophonist brought him to New York to work alongside him in his own band and in a host of the city’s top recording sessions (along with Rainey, they toured the U.S.A. with The Beatles in 1965). Dupree impressed Purdie because, as he says, “his solos were always the blues.” And Dupree impressed just about everyone for his uncanny ability to play lead and rhythm guitar inter- changeably, or simultaneously. While he allowed himself to say, with a laugh, “I was dangerous in the studios, I was just rampaging with sessions,” his description of his technique revealed his humility. As Dupree said:It’s something you develop when you back yourself up, when you don’t have anybody to back you up. You got to just make it happen to make it a full band. To sound as big as you can, to do as much as you can to make it good. When you’re playing, you want something to back you up: You play your lead part and if you see an empty spot, you jump in there to fill it up. Someone else is playing, you want to jump in and back them up to make them sound good. And that’s the way I look at it — fill it up and make it sound good for the other person.Rainey backed-up soul groups and checked out jazz bassists in New York. He adds that the city’s diverse environment made his colleagues more aggressive and versatile than the Southern-based musicians who backed Franklin’s earlier Atlantic recordings. Wexler has said he admired Rainey’s playing technique called “sliding tenths.”8 The bassist said that this way of reaching low notes and high octave notes at the same time (on open E, A, D, and G strings) came from watching older upright players in those Manhattan jazz clubs, especially Milt Hinton, Earl May, and Richard Davis. And from the way he was built for his instrument.\n\n“Coming from guitar to the bass, my hands are kind of thick and big and there were a lot of things I wanted to do on the guitar that I just couldn’t because the guitar was just not my instrument,” Rainey said. “The strings are too small and too close, and so the bass is perfect.”\n\nPurdie has generally been depicted as the effervescent egotist of the group: the soul-jazz equivalent of a young Muhammad Ali. The New York Times reported that, “For years he showed up at sessions with two professionally made signs, which he would place on music stands near his kit. ‘You done hired the hit maker,’ read one. ‘If you need me, call me, the little old hit maker,’ said the other.”9 That image almost contrasts with what he told DownBeat in 1971: “‘I’ve given up trying to be the best — nobody can do it. There is always someone better. Now all I want to be is the prettiest.’”10\n\nIn either case, the gregarious drummer’s reputation stems from his pattern that has been called the Purdie Shuffle. It’s a fast, tightly syncopated, fluid groove that he created through unexpected hits on the high-hat, bass, and snare, and modeled on the sounds of trains roaring past his Maryland childhood home:We had a train station in Elkton and the train could take off, or slow down, at speeds unheard of. It was a sound that I tried to recreate by trying to make that sound go forward. Energy. And it is all about energy, it is all about making a feel and putting yourself in the body of this locomotion. That’s the way I looked at music. I always looked at it as a forward motion and keeping everybody happy.The drummer’s early experiences in the churches also informed the Purdie Shuffle. But he adds that the pacing of the music in a church service was not always compatible with the tempos he added to his percussive movements. Purdie summarized his technique as: “You have to give it a chance to sink in, that means watching people’s body movements, how they moved their feet, how they dance, how they sway.”\n\nAll of it came together in the first song that this group recorded with Franklin, her luminous “Rock Steady,” which was taped at Miami’s Criteria Studios on February 16, 1971, and which appeared on Young, Gifted and Black. It’s a deep funk track, with Purdie’s beat driving the initial propulsion. Guest percussionist Dr. John joins in and underpins Franklin’s assertive and warm voice woven along with Hathaway’s organ lines. Just as Franklin and her sisters Erma and Carolyn had added hip urban slang in the call-and-response section of her version of “Respect” (“sock it to me”) four years earlier, she did the same for this hit single (“what it is”). The song also sounds like it was looking ahead to the next decade’s r&b. The group’s method showed why they’d be able to successfully record naturally live in a church the following year. As Rainey said:Bernard and I had worked so many sessions in New York together, we were sort of like twins. Actually, our birthdays are six days apart. We’re in Miami and where they had the band staying was different from where Jerry Wexler, [producer] Tommy Dowd and [engineer] Gene Paul were staying. Usually when we started those sessions, they had one car pick up the band, and another pick up those people. This particular day they were about an hour late. Because we all knew each other and were a family, Aretha would just sit down, she would show all the songs that she wrote. We wanted to do ‘Rock Steady,’ we sat down, and she decided to put it down for reference. So we just laid down the track. When [arranger] Arif [Mardin] and those people came to the studio, we began to work on the song. They tried all morning to try and work on the song, but never got to the feel of what we already laid down. It’s a run down before everybody got there. When you’re free like that, you’re having fun.Franklin must have also noticed how her friend and early mentor Cleveland was flourishing in California. His rise from wrenching poverty on Chicago’s South Side to success as a gospel innovator in Los Angeles is reason enough for his own biography. A laudatory feature in the November 1968 issue of Ebony begins with Cleveland at the Apollo telling the audience how he was once so poor he had “no food on my table ... no shoes on my feet ...” and from there to his ten-room Spanish style house in Los Angeles’ Leimert Park neighborhood. That scene conjures images from the video to Biggie Smalls’ “Juicy” decades later but without the rapper’s heterosexual machismo. Along with the 275 songs Cleveland wrote, it’s mentioned that he taught Franklin “much of what she knows about piano.”11\n\nCleveland also may have shown her more than a few things about songwriting, particularly in the building of tempo and tension to the ecstatic levels of “Jesus Saves” from his album James Cleveland and the Angelic Choir, Vol. 3: “Peace be Still.” The title track, with its constantly mounting feeling of urgency, was pivotal for gospel, especially as his rough voice challenged the sweetness in the large vocal group behind him. James Baldwin once told his friend Heilbut that just the way Cleveland sang the word “master” was terrifying. “Peace be Still” was a huge hit with 800,000 copies allegedly sold, although Cleveland’s label, Savoy, was disreputable with numbers.12 The title song has been covered just as many different ways, although an interesting interpretation came from Giovanni, who recorded it on her own choir album Truth is on its Way shortly before Amazing Grace.\n\n“‘Peace be Still’ always intrigued me,” Giovanni said. “Peace being still, rather than peace being busy. Peace as a noun. Peace as a person. I was looking at peace as an entity. He was quoting Jesus. And I was bringing it to the 20th century then. Saying, no, the rumblings of this peace must be still.”\n\nSince moving to Los Angeles and forming the James Cleveland Singers in 1962, Cleveland became a gospel industry kingmaker. Within his new city, the gospel audience expanded considerably since the ’40s. Jacqueline DjeDje chalks that up to black migration, institutional support among large churches, and more media attention, particularly radio broadcasts.13 Los Angeles was also the site for an important gospel gathering at the Shrine Auditorium that featured The Caravans (with Cleveland) and The Soul Stirrers (with Sam Cooke); it was captured on the album The Great 1955 Shrine Concert (Specialty), another live forerunner to Amazing Grace. In 1967, Cleveland established the Gospel Music Workshop of America (GMWA), which had the initial purpose of educating and training young gospel singers, but evolved into a juggernaut through its annual conventions that are still being held today. The GMWA organizational model followed the National Baptist Convention. Essentially, this made bigger choirs the norm, and Cleveland had them trained to sing as a single instrument. This constituted a major shift in focus for the music from the time Cleveland and Franklin were growing up. Those days featured smaller vocal groups, such as The Caravans, and choirs were not a polished commercial force. As that Ebony profile extolled, through the GMWA, Cleveland was “good enough to put together a 300-voice choir within days of arrival at any town.” Cleveland turned neighborhood singers into the disciplined Southern California Community Choir in Los Angeles. Archbishop Carl Bean, the city’s founder of Unity Fellowship of Christ Church, and a gospel and disco singer knew this since the ’60s.\n\n“The voices would be very exact,” Bean said. “James was a stickler for clarity around lyrics. I don’t care how fast the tempo, with James’ choir you heard the words, you heard the parts very clearly and the harmony sitting very well.”\n\nEssentially, while Purdie, Rainey, and Dupree made the rhythm section chug and flow with uncanny unison, Cleveland had applied similar methods to the mass choir.\n\nAt home in Los Angeles, Cleveland’s circle of talented, sometimes classically trained, musicians built their own identities after being a part of his gang — like Billy Preston. Another kid in that clique was Alexander Hamilton, who began writing scores at the age of 6, studied at the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music and Arts, played organ behind Mahalia Jackson, and then joined Cleveland’s coterie. When he and I had lunch near the church in which he is pastor, in Compton, it became clear why the leader must have depended on him: along with his prodi- gious musical skills, Hamilton has the combination of easygoing good humor and dedication that enabled him to thrive in this tough neighborhood. He served as Cleveland’s assistant choir director, including on Amazing Grace.\n\nAs Hamilton says about Cleveland:The circle wasn’t that big — we all knew each other. Of course, he was already pretty much THE James Cleveland by then. He was in a very interesting position: he had come up through the ranks back East, in the Midwest. And he got a contract with Savoy and it worked great. I think he had eight, ten albums a year he had to do. Way it worked was all he had to do was have his name on it and one song to get paid. Real smart of him — he would look around to the good groups and say, “I’m James Cleveland and will get you on Savoy.” We’d do one marathon, six, seven hour session and the album would be done. It would be “James Cleveland Presents ...” and he became known as the Star Maker, which put him in a better place than just being the star. Everybody in the country knew that if James Cleveland liked you, he might get you on Savoy, which was basically the gospel music label of the day.\n\nIt was sort of fun being one of the king’s kids. We got instant respect anywhere we went. He was a nut, but he was fun. You got to be nuts. Especially in gospel because you’re not getting paid most of the time. When you look at the field, the genre, and you look at the people doing it compared to the people actually making a living at it, it doesn’t exist. He was one of the few who was able to make it, and part of it was by doing the James Cleveland Presents. That made him rich. He was in the right place at the right time. There couldn’t be one like him now.Even during the mid ’60s, Hamilton adds that instrumental accompaniment to gospel groups, including Cleveland’s massive choirs, was usually minimal:It was still, not taboo, but just not done. Drums and the rest of those things in the Baptist churches were just beginning here and there. COGIC churches didn’t mind using tambourines, which Baptists did not. Baptists, COGIC to a degree, gospel music people are very conservative. There’s a joke, “How many Baptists does it take to change a light bulb?” The answer is, “What do you mean, change?”Still, Cleveland used drummers on his Savoy records, including a young Purdie who remembers those pre-Amazing Grace sessions primarily because of the leader’s personality.\n“He had his act together, morning, noon and night,” Purdie said. “He could raise more money than the Pinkertons. The man just knew what buttons to push on everybody. It was just that good.”\n\nAll of which made inevitable the ambitious reunion among Aretha and C. L. Franklin, James Cleveland and his Southern California Community Choir, along with Atlantic’s top producers and rhythm section.Note...\n\n3 Among many examples is Wexler’s memoir (written with Ritz), Rhythm and the Blues (New York: Knopf, 1993).\n\n4 The “ride, Sally ride” line derives from Pickett’s hit, “Mustang Sally,” which Sir Mack Rice wrote with an assist from Franklin.\n\n5 Ed Ochs, “Soul Sauce,” Billboard, May 23, 1970, 50, and Edward M.

Uh, I shake and tremble!\nAnd uh, I face a gamble - we fear to disappear!\nI am so confused - this deal turned me so hollow!\nI wonder is Haas tomorrow? Did Rich seal our fate? (Is it too late?)\n\n(Uh!) The odds are looking blurred! All of Twitter has heard!\nI wonder and ponder - and what the hell?!\nRich Energy's poison to the veins!\nWill Storey is fucked up in the brain!\n\n[Chorus]\nRab! Rab! RabaRabaRabaRaba!\nNow the Haas team is scared - 2019 they were lost\nNeeded money and the drinks to outpower the Renault\nNow what they need most is hope (and Robert of course!)\n\n[Verse 2  - Rob Kubica]\nRoba used to drink the fucking Rich Energy\nEvery day, every week. Make me faster, make me speed!\nMake me focused, make me rich! Make me beat the Russell bitch\nBought a ton, bought a lot! Hid it in a secret spot!\n\nThen I read a lot of stuff! (What the fuck even is Rich Energy?)\nCan't believe how they fucked Guenther up - now I'm amok!\nWilliam Storey - I will beat his ass, mess his beard up\nHack his Twitter - write some career-ending evil stuff!\nJail the boy, by the way - show him what I'm made of!\n\n[Chorus]\nRab! Rab! RabaRabaRabaRaba!\nNow the Haas team is scared - 2019 they were lost\nNeeded money and the drinks to outpower the Renault\nNow what they need most is hope (and Robert of course!)\n(Ebi-juice... baguette... uhh... lingerie... Grosjean!)\n\n[Verse 3 - Crashjean]\nI'm Grosjean, je m'appelle fucking \"Crash Machine\"\nI wish you could see the speed I carry - wish I had a win!\nI'm a good driver - I just complain a lot\nComplain all the time, so much I crash - 'cause focus? I do not!\nWell, let me tell you 'bout a ridiculous idiot!\nWilliam Storey is fucking my brain - boy he's vicious! (Vicious)\nWe had energy drinks for two days maybe\nAnd he walked around the team and told them all to hate me (What?!)\n\nHe gave a little bit of money to Haas. (Haas!)\n'Cause, otherwise we couldn't afford the gas! (The gas!)\nWe need the bread - Haas is a boulangerie! (Boulangerie!)\nAnd if he comes back, it will be a boucherie! (Boucherie)\nOnly ones we collab with is Ferrari! (Ferrari)\nSo get mad! In a bunch is all your lingerie! (Lingerie!)\nI built Haas! Don't come fuck up mon ami! (Mon ami!)\nYou sell a scam! Motherfuck, I c'est la vie! (C'est la vie!)\n\n[Chorus]\nRab! Rab! RabaRabaRabaRaba!\nNow the Haas team is scared - 2019 they were lost\nNeeded money and the drinks to outpower the Renault\nNow what they need most is hope\n\n\n[ 6. BACK LUCK FREESTYLE - FEAT ALFONSO ]\n\n[Interlude:]\nThank you so much to Robert and Crashjean for appearing on that song. What an amazing track!\nIf you are enjoying it, I think you should go subscribe to Sim Dane and put on the notification bell\nWe are lacking towards the end, so this next song \"Bad Luck Freestyle\" is gonna be the last one. Cheers!\n\n[Intro - Gangsta Guenther, Alfonso:]\n- Guenther: Fucking Guenther and Alfonso on the track together. Go get 'em Alfonso\n- Alfonso: I'm Alfonso - Alonso... The good ol' gonzo! (Ya!)\n\n[Verse 1 - Alfonso]\nI'm Alfonso - didn't have a lot of fun, bro!\nDidn't get the one \"oh-so-hard-to-get\" damn championship!\nI thought each year: \"I could have it\", ooh\nI changed teams six times, can't handle it\nI'm so fast and lit, I had plans to quit in '14 after 2 titles\nMatched all my rivals - kinda got entitled towards the end\n\nYeah... it's been a tough ride. Became a tough guy\nNow Honda really fucks my choices up, I've been voicing what I shouldn't. Whatever, man, GP2 engine sucked anyway\nSo I don't give a fuck now. I think back 12 years and just how\nI would have been champ. If I stayed at McLaren, but I didn't\nCan't even cope with how bad it drove - the '08 Renault and '09 was just a yoke\n\nOhhh, Alonso doesn't wanna come again\n'Cause Renault doesn't even like my plans\nAnd I know, and I know, and I know I burned some bridges\nBut all things I said, I said in jest\n\n[Verse 2 - Gangsta Guenther]\nWell, I don't fucking give a fuck about nobody anymore, really...\nWhat I saw from sponsors and from drivers made the team feel unlucky. Why do bad things happen to the best people?\nWith all the bad happened to me, one would think I'm evil\n\nHaas deserves 4th place and stability\nAnd a pit crew with a consistent ability\nWe don't want a situation at the season opener\nLike '18 or '19, '17 was much doper!\n\nGuenther has the fucking power, the fuck smash!\nI consider renaming the team from Haas to Hash\nI'm so tired of dealing with broken doors and crashes\nBut I'm strong, so Haas will rise from the ashes\n\n[Outro:]\nFucking Guenther. Thank you so much for listening to my mixtape\nPlease go and subscribe to Sim Dane, press notification on\nBest wishes to everybody out there\n\n\n[ VIDEO OUTRO - SIM DANE ]\nThank you so much for watching.
